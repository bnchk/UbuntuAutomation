# Ubuntu Automation - simple scripts<br>
These scripts were put together while learning about running internet facing Ubuntu boxes.<br>
They automate some common tasks + communicate via push message.<br>
There would be many other ways to achieve this, eg Prometheus/Grafana etc - but these are result a learning path for myself.<br>
While they work for me, I can't vouch for them as I don't know what I don't know. Apart from knowing it's a lot.<br>
Any feedback/suggestions most welcome.<br><br>
<br>
All scripts require setup of push message account as per [push-message-setup](https://github.com/bnchk/UbuntuAutomation/tree/main/push-message-setup) <br>
<br>
## Scripts cover:<br>
* logon notifications<br>
* patching<br>
* monitoring<br>
* node/relay automation (Cardano projects Iagon+Encoins+WM)<br>
* ZFS pool(disk array) monitoring
<br>
